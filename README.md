This Python script is a simple stock analysis tool designed to visualize stock price movements and daily returns. It uses yfinance to fetch historical data, pandas for data analysis, and matplotlib for generating informative plots. The program allows users to input a specific stock ticker or analyze a default list of major stocks. It then generates and saves a plot of the stock's price and daily returns as a PNG file, and exports the raw data to a CSV file for further use.
